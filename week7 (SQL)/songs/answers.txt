1. Audio aura can be calculated based on energy, daceability, tempo and this kind of paramateres. We can know for example that a person is happy if
the person is listening songs faster or with a higher tempo or maybe songs that are easy to dance.

2. Its may not be representative, becouse maybe you can be a very happy person, but maybe you just listen music in some kind or relax situation, or maybe
you just listen music when you are sad and this is the reason why you may listen songs with lower tempo or slower kind of songs.
